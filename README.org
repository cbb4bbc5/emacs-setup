#+TITLE: Description of my Emacs configuration

* Overview

This repository contains handwritten configuration files for Emacs. Right now it
only consists of ~init.el~ but I plan to make it modular in the future.

* Usage

** Simple download

I use bare git repositories for projects like this but the most straightforward
way to get my configuration is to use

#+begin_src shell
  git clone https://github.com/cbb4bbc5/emacs-setup.git ~/.emacs.d
#+end_src

** TODO Bare repository
